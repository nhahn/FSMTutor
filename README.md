# FSM Tutor

### Installing

To install the FSM tutor, you need to do a couple of things:
1. Download all of the display dependencies using bower. Just run a `bower install` to get started. If you don't have bower installed, install it using `npm -g install bower`. 
2. Have some type of way to host the CTAT files. Because of browser security permissions, opening the files locally does not work correctly. We have been using a MAMP server for easy hosting.
